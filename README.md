## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
3 of my favorite apps include:
    X:
        * I like the simple UI
        * Ability to comment pictures or GIFs in other peoples tweets
    Instagram:
        *I like the post format
        *Deleting Old messages
    Youtube:
        *Watch long form content
        *Ability to rate the video and share opinions in the comments

An app I would like to build is a running tracking app. Features would include a step counter based on information from the data the Health app collects or from data collected using external gear like smartwatches. I would also like it to have the ability to trace the path you have taken while on a walk or run. It would also give you the exact distance you have traveled, whether it's for the whole day or from the moment it notices that the user has started being active. No ads! It would keep track of the steps from previous days, store the data, and output the average steps per week, month, and year, depending on how much data has been collected. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Not many challenges besides not knowing much UI features. When working on the projecting I was wondering where did view.backgroundColor even come from but it works so I guess that is it for now. I will have to dive more into Swift or SwiftUI.
